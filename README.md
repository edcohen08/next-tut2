# Next.js tutorial 2

The first tutorial which just focuses on Next.js is in next-tuts/ninjalist. It actively lives in next-tut1 and any changes there will be actualized in Vercel but any changes here will not show up in the Vercel. 

The second tutorial is in next-tuts/contentful-tut. It focuses on Next.js and Contentful and is deployed to Vercel through this repo.
